# IdealOS Sidecar

Sidecar is a local web-based debugger app for IdealOS. It's written in React and should run on the same machine as your
IdealOS instance.

Sidecar lets you connect to a running IdealOS instance, list the apps, view the logs, and visually interact
with the OS, just like the main display server. Thus it serves as an alternate implementation of the
Display API for IdealOS (the other one is written in native Rust code).
